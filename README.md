1. [13-12.ipynb](https://github.com/Anacoder1/NLP_Tasks/blob/master/13-12.ipynb) - Doing basic stuff with the Brown and Inaugural corpora.

2. [19-12.ipynb](https://github.com/Anacoder1/NLP_Tasks/blob/master/19-12.ipynb) - Exploring different language versions of the Stopwords corpus, playing around with the Wordnet and CMUDict lexicons, and using the Tweet Tokenizer.

3. [10-01.ipynb](https://github.com/Anacoder1/NLP_Tasks/blob/master/10-01.ipynb) - Working with the Porter Stemmer, Snowball Stemmer, Lancaster Stemmer, RegExp Stemmer and WordNet Lemmatizer

4. [NLP_26_02.ipynb](https://github.com/Anacoder1/NLP_Tasks/blob/master/NLP_26_02.ipynb) - Using Porter Stemmer on random text, using the WordNet Lemmatizer, viewing the applications of CountVectorizer, TfidfVectorizer and Cosine Similarity and installing the Spacy library

5. [NLP_26_02_and_28_02.ipynb](https://github.com/Anacoder1/NLP_Tasks/blob/master/NLP_26_02_%26_28_02.ipynb) - The same as [NLP_26_02.ipynb](https://github.com/Anacoder1/NLP_Tasks/blob/master/NLP_26_02.ipynb), in addition to finding cosine similarities for collections of text (texts are collected from 3 National Geographic magazine articles)

6. [CRF.ipynb](https://github.com/Anacoder1/NLP_Tasks/blob/master/CRF.ipynb) - Sequence Labeling on a NER (Named Entity Recognition) model using CRF in Python 
#### Note: 6) was run on Google Colab, and won't run on Juptyer notebook or Juypter Lab
